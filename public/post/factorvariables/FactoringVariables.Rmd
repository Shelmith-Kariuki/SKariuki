There are 5 ways (that I know of) in which we can factorise multiple  variables in R.

+ One by one (an option for beginners).
+ Using a for loop.
+ lapply()
+ forcats::fct_relevel()
+ purrr::map()

### 0. Load the packages that we will require
<br> 

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## Create a vector of packages that we will need
pkgs <- c("dplyr","purrr","repurrrsive")

## Check if there are variables you want to load, that are not already installed. 
miss_pkgs <- pkgs[!pkgs %in% installed.packages()[,1]] 

## Installing the missing packages
if(length(miss_pkgs)>0){
  install.packages(miss_pkgs)
}

## Loading all the packages
invisible(lapply(pkgs,library,character.only=TRUE))

## Remove the objects that are no longer required
rm(miss_pkgs)
rm(pkgs)


```

Assuming you have a matrix type question (where respondents were asked to rate the questions on a scale of 1 - 5, where 1 represents Strongly Disagree and 5 represents Strongly Agree). 
<br>
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

set.seed(2020)

vec <- 1:5
Questions <- paste0("Opinion_",vec)
opinion_df <- data.frame(matrix("", ncol=5, nrow=200))
names(opinion_df) <- Questions

for(i in 1: length(Questions)){
 opinion_df[,Questions[i]] <- sample(c("Strongly Agree", "Agree","Neutral","Disagree", "Strongly Disagree"),size = 200,replace = TRUE) 
}

head(opinion_df, 10)
```

### 1. Factorizing one by one
<br>
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
opinion_df2 <- opinion_df

## Opinion_1
opinion_df2$Opinion_1 <- factor(opinion_df2$Opinion_1,
                                levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
                                labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"))

## Opinion_2
opinion_df2$Opinion_2 <- factor(opinion_df2$Opinion_2,
                                levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
                                labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"))

## Sorry, I cannot continue with this replication

```

### 2. Using a for loop
<br>
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

opinion_df3 <- opinion_df

factor_function <- function(data,var){
  data[,var] <- factor(data[,var],
                  levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
                  labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"))
  
  return(data[,var])
}

for( i in 1:length(Questions)){
 opinion_df3[,Questions[i]] <- factor_function(opinion_df3,Questions[i])
 print(levels(opinion_df3[,Questions[i]]))
}

```

### 3. Using lapply(). 

sapply() is kind of usually moody at times, and this was one of those days. So I used lapply(), and it works.
<br>

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

opinion_df <- data.frame(opinion_df)

opinion_df4 <- as.data.frame(lapply(opinion_df, function(x) factor(x,
            levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
            labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"))),check.names = FALSE)

levels(opinion_df3$Opinion_4)

```

### 4. Using forcats::fct_relevel()
<br>
```{r}

opinion_df5 <- opinion_df %>%
  dplyr::mutate_all(forcats::fct_relevel, "Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly Agree")

levels(opinion_df5$Opinion_4)
```


### 5. Using purrr::map()
<br>
The syntax is written  as map(.x,.f) i.e for each element of .x, do .f
<br> 
```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

opinion_df6 <-bind_rows(map(opinion_df, ~factor(.x,
 levels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"),
 labels = c("Strongly Disagree", "Disagree","Neutral","Agree", "Strongly Agree"))))


levels(opinion_df6$Opinion_4)

```
