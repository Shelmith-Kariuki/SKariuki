      <title>The RStudio Certification Process</title>
      <link>/post/certification/</link>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, I was lucky to be certified as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/&#34;&gt;RStudio Certified Tidyverse trainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certification process was totally amazing. It was led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gvwilson&#34;&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt; who is a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RStudioEDU&#34;&gt;RStudio Education team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three steps to becoming certified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candidates must take part in a training course on modern teaching methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After completing that course, candidates must complete a 90-minute exam on the material that includes preparing and delivering a 15-minute demonstration lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, in order to ensure that instructors are proficient with the technical content they will be teaching, they must complete a practical examination and deliver a demonstration for each subject they wish to be certified in.
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The training took place on 18th and 19th January, from 8:00 PM to around midnight EAT, on both days. The class comprised of around 12 participants, and 4 instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of material was covered in those 2 days, but I will only mention a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I learnt how to &lt;strong&gt;distinguish between a novice, a competent student and an expert&lt;/strong&gt;. As an instructor, you know a novice is learning, when they search for the right things, and can recognize useful answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, I got to learn about &lt;strong&gt;cognitive load&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the total amount of mental activity imposed on working memory in any one instant. There are three forms of cognitive load. Intrinsic load (this is what people have to keep in mind, in order to absorb new material), germane load (the desirable mental effort required to to link new information to the old information) and extraneous load (anything that distracts learning). As a trainer, one can take care of the mental capacity of students, by chunking i.e dividing your lesson plan into many tiny bits (you would rather have 3 2-hour lessons, than 2 3-hour lessons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learnt a lot on &lt;strong&gt;assessments&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two kinds of assessments; formative and summative. A formative assessment is one where the trainer uses questions or exercises during the lesson in order to figure out if learning has taken place (think of CATS or RATS), while summative assessment tells you if the learner has mastered the material taught, and is ready to go out on their own (think of the end of semester exam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another really interesting thing I learnt, was the idea of &lt;strong&gt;concept maps&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a graphical tool that instructional designers use to organize and structure knowledge. I did not study this in school, so it was really new and interesting. Since then, I have used concept maps to guide my teaching, and my work basically. I even had to create a concept map to guide me in writing this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think that 4 hours is quite a long time to sit for a session, but it was not the case for these sessions. The instructors encouraged us to take regular 5-10 minutes breaks. They also kept us engaged by asking us to discuss ideas amongst ourselves, and even put some of our thoughts on a google doc (this is such an amazing way to keeping students active during a training session).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the two-day training, we each had to reserve an exam date, on Greg’s calendar. I decided to sit for both exams in about 3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those 3 weeks, I prepared adequately. One had to have good knowledge on tidyverse concepts before sitting for the exam, so this was not part of the training. Luckily, I had been using tidyverse since 2017, so I had mastered a majority of the concepts. Nevertheless, I still had to brush through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;R for Data Science book&lt;/a&gt; , to remind myself of a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was a teaching assistant, I always enjoyed giving exams. Seems I had forgotten how it felt having to sit for one myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day, I woke up very very nervous. I did not know what to expect. I spent the day &lt;a href=&#34;https://shelkariuki.netlify.app/post/passa/&#34;&gt;writing these codes&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure that I was 100% ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was to sit for the tidyverse exam from 8:00 PM - 9:30 PM EAT and the teaching exam from 9:30 PM - 11:00 PM EAT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tidyverse exam was amazing, I loved how it was set. It covered &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the tidyverse concepts. I was very very tensed, but the cheerful Greg made the process smooth. I wount lie, there were 2 questions that made me sweat a lot, but luckily, we were allowed to consult Google, when things got thick, and more often than not, Google rarely disappoints. In 90 minutes, I was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a 10-15 minutes break, after which I was ready for the teaching exam.
The first step involved delivering a 15 minutes lesson to Greg. I chose to teach him some basic dplyr concepts. The next step involved answering a few questions based on the 2 day training we had earlier. This exam also took 90 minutes, so by midnight I was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received the results 10-15 minutes after completing the teaching exam. That feeling you get when the certificate comes through, is unexplainable. Two days later (on February 14th), I was added to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/&#34;&gt;“wall of fame”&lt;/a&gt; (best valentines day ever!! no bouquet of flowers could ever beat that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank my amazing friend, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dickoah&#34;&gt;Ahmadou&lt;/a&gt;, for encouraging me to go for it. I also want to thank Greg and the entire RStudio Education team for making the process an enjoyable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing rKenyaCensus</title>

&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus&#34;&gt;rKenyaCensus&lt;/a&gt; is an R package that contains the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census results. The results were released by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KNBStats&#34;&gt;Kenya National Bureau of Statistics&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020, and published in four different pdf files (Volume 1 - Volume 4).
&lt;style&gt;
body {text-align: justify}
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/Resultsannouncement.png&#34; width=&#34;388&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These files can be downloaded from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.knbs.or.ke/?page_id=3142&#34;&gt;the KNBS website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census was the eighth to be conducted in Kenya since 1948 and was conducted from the night of 24th /25th to 31st August 2019. Kenya leveraged on technology to capture data during cartographic mapping, enumeration and data transmission, making the 2019 Census the first paperless census to be conducted in Kenya (KNBS did a good job 👏, 👏, 👏, 👏).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development version of the package can be installed in R via:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;devtools::install_github(“Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus”)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: You first have to have devtools installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each table has been scrapped and given a unique identifier, e.g V1.T2.3 is the data in table 2.3 of Volume 1.
&lt;img src=&#34;img/datalist2.png&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;DataCatalogue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; dataset contains a list of the different datasets that are contained in this package. To learn more about each of the different datasets, run ?datasetname, e.g&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;?V1_T2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This opens up a “Help” page where you can get more information about the dataset, as well as the description of each of the variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/helppage.png&#34; width=&#34;393&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 47,564,296 persons were enumerated during the census, comprising 23,548,056 males, 24,014,716 females and 1,524 intersex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/mutiso2.png&#34; width=&#34;318&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: The idea behind the coord polar graph above was to display the population distribution per County and Gender, ordered by decreasing population size. The bars have only been used to distinguish between male and female proportions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results indicate a population growth of nine million since the exercise was last carried out 10 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;figs/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nairobi, Nakuru and Kiambu registered the highest population counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;figs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;1152&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandera, Wajir and Garissa registered the highest average household size, while Nairobi, Kirinyaga and Kiambu registered the least average household size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/mutisodark.png&#34; width=&#34;3200&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of creating this package was amazing. I used the tabulizer R package to scrap the data from the different pdfs, though I faced a small glitch while trying to scrap two or three of the datasets. For those tables, I used data that had already been scrapped, and was readily available on the internet, even though I had to clean it further. I used the &lt;em&gt;usethis&lt;/em&gt; package to “attach” the data onto the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to come up with the package for a host of reasons. To begin with, I believe that people prefer working with data when it is in an “easy to use” format, as opposed to it being in pdf format. The data has been simplified so that data analysts can play around with it, without having to go through the “dirty” process themselves. I am hoping that people can use the data to practise data visualizations, and come up with amazing graphs (or better still, amazing shiny dashboards).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also always wanted to learn package development through a real life project. I am glad that I can now use the &lt;em&gt;usethis::use_data(xxx, overwrite = T)&lt;/em&gt; command, and I know what &lt;em&gt;“r cmd-check”&lt;/em&gt; is (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JennyBryan&#34;&gt;Jenny Bryan&lt;/a&gt; for creating and maintaining the package). I also needed to work on a project that I could showcase, during my next interview, incase they ask how I spent my time during the Covid19 pandemic (yes, I am job hunting 😿, 😿, 😿, 😿).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the datasets are exactly as they appear in the pdf files, but for some, I tried manipulating them a little bit so that people could easily use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/countymerge.png&#34; width=&#34;675&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got shapefiles of Kenya County boundaries from a friend (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Akothcarole&#34;&gt;Carole&lt;/a&gt;), but unfortunately, I was not able to include them in the package. They can be downloaded &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.humdata.org/dataset/47-counties-of-kenya&#34;&gt;from this site&lt;/a&gt;. I hope that spatial data analysts could use this data to develop awesome maps (I can’t wait to see what you all come up with 💃, 💃, 💃).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the major lessons I learnt from the process is that data cleaning is a very very important skill (well, I have always known this, but I am now more convinced). A huge thanks to my friends at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/R4DScommunity&#34;&gt;R4DS community&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ascensionasana&#34;&gt;Stephen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/scottcame&#34;&gt;Scott Came&lt;/a&gt;, who came through when I needed help on certain issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/stephscott.png&#34; width=&#34;630&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to appreciate my friends (Tabby, Eric, Nangira, Evelyne, AnnMaureen, Caren and Peter), for taking their time to check the data in the package, against the data in the pdf files. We are confident that this work is error free, but please raise an alarm if you think something is amiss. I also want to thank the amazing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/johnmutiso_&#34;&gt;John Mutiso&lt;/a&gt;, who spent some hours generating some of the amazing graphs that are embedded on this post. Mutiso has been generating awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TidyTuesday&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;#TidyTuesday&lt;/a&gt; graphs as well. He was lucky enough to have one of his graphs published in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rweekly.org/#get-&#34;&gt;rweekly.org&lt;/a&gt; website (💪, 💪).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/mutisorweekly.png&#34; width=&#34;360&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer alert&lt;/strong&gt;: This package is still &lt;strong&gt;work in progress&lt;/strong&gt;. The data is being cleaned and refined on a daily basis. Changes (Volume 3) are being pushed to github every afternoon beginning 29th April, 2020. Please keep refreshing (re-installing) the package, so that you have the most updated version. I am yet to work on Volume 4 of the results. I will post an update once I am done with that.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Volume 4 data is ready, and the package has been updated. Volume 4 includes data showing the distribution of school attendance, work activity (those working vs those job hunting), dominant wall, floor and roofing material of main dwelling units, agricultural data (crops and livestock) for each county, data on different types of disabilities, ownership of mobile phones, usage of the internet, percentage of births that take place in a health facility vs those that take place in a non-health facility, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different datasets can also be downloaded as .csv or .xlsx files, &lt;a href=&#34;https://shel-kariuki.shinyapps.io/KenyaCensus2019/&#34;&gt;from this shiny app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also hoping to submit the package to CRAN, once the development version is stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/G4Ihli2UThrBS/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to discuss further improvements to the package, so please feel free to contact me through the contact form, at the bottom of this site. Again, &lt;strong&gt;incase you come across a bug, please do reach out as well, either via the contact form, or better still, open an issue on github.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parting shot: &lt;strong&gt;If you have an amazing idea, start working on it, the end product will satisfy your soul&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guess what!! We shall overcome Covid19, but before then, keep safe, stay at home, wash your hands regularly and &lt;strong&gt;if you have to leave your premises&lt;/strong&gt;, please wear a mask. It shall be well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe everyone!🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪&lt;/p&gt;
