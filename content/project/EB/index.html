<p>Company_XXX is an online company that meets the growing demand for independent travel information. it offers an extensive hotel meta search to travellers.</p>
<p>Company_XXX hosts different case studies on their website, that job applicants can work on.</p>
<p>Task:
<em>The task consists of user visit data, stored as a csv.</em>
<em>First, we would like you to perform some descriptive analysis of the data at hand. What can you tell us about the visits that are included? Imagine that you want to understand our product and think about what would be important for you. Explore the data, get a feel for how it is structured and show us what you can do. Some topics you may want to look into are:</em></p>
<p><em>What is good for the product, what is bad?</em>
+ <em>Anomalies in data</em>
+ <em>Inferences from the data</em></p>
<p><em>Secondly define three KPI’s for the performance of the product and show how they are calculated. Describe what you see and try to think about why these developments might be happening. Define plausible reasons for any changes you might observe in the data.</em></p>

<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>The first part of the challenge involved analysis of user visit data.</p>
<p>The data provided is only one day’s worth, as is shown by the minimum timestamp, i.e 2018-06-13 and maximum timestamp, i.e 2018-06-13 23:59:59</p>
<p>The data contains 142599 unique participants, and a total of 156638 unique sessions, meaning on average
1.1 sessions per user.</p>
<p>The analysis sought to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On average, how many times did users visit the website?</p></li>
<li><p>Of those who visited the website only once, how many made successive bookings?</p></li>
<li><p>Of those who visited the website more than once, what was the rate of successful bookings?</p></li>
<li><p>Where are most of the website users based?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there a trend in website visit times? Do users prefer visiting the website in the morning, afternoon or evening?</p></li>
<li><p>Generally, what is the length of time between the booking date and start of travel date?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the distribution of advertisers</p></li>
<li><p>Which advertiser results into a majority of booking errors?</p></li>
<li><p>For those who only visit the website once and never succeed in booking, how far along is the travel date from the booking date? Is it that they do not log in again because the trip is not that urgent?</p></li>
<li><p>For those who visited the website more than once, what is the average length of time between the first visit and second visit?</p></li>
<li><p>For those who re-visit the website within one hour, after how many minutes do they do so?</p></li>
<li><p>For those who visited the website more than once and were not successful in making a booking in the first instance, after how many trials (sessions) were they successful?</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="on-average-how-many-times-did-users-visit-the-website" class="section level4">
<h4>1. On average, how many times did users visit the website?</h4>
<p>From the plot given below, a majority of the users (94%) visited the website only once. I would be keen to find out whether they made successive bookings.</p>

<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>The second part of the challenge involved a dataset showing list of actions, of the users in part 1. Each row in the data corresponds to a logged event</p>
<p>The questions I sought to answer in this task include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What actions are common? Can we think how this relates to the Company_XXX Express Booking?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the most common final actions for a user? Why is that?</p></li>
<li><p>How are actions distributed and can we infer anything from that?</p></li>
<li><p>What might be the action that we consider as a conversion? Is there a feasible way to verify that?</p></li>
